💖 I love the web3 space because it's [for everyone, and full of interesting things to create](https://lulox.notion.site/Newbies-Lounge-68ea7c4c5f1a4ec29786be6a76516878) 🔥<br />
🪄 I use [Scaffold-ETH 2](https://scaffoldeth.io/) (**TypeScript**, **Next.js**, **React**, **TailwindCSS**, **daisyUI**, **Wagmi** and **RainbowKit**) for building web3 dApps. <br />
🌱 <b>Smart contracts?</b> Written in **Solidity**, using [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation) for testing and deploying<br />
